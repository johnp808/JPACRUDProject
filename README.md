# JPACRUDProject #

## Overview ##
Created a full stack project for a local database. which displays a home page and shows a group of resellers along with their avatars which you can click and it will display their stats. You have a choice of searching by the resellers id number as well. Once checking their stats you should be able to update the Resellers stats, delete them from the database or go back home.

## Problems Faced ##
I spent 7 hours on saturday looking for why my database was not loading my reseller.. It was because I had to change resellers to reseller on my home.jsp
I spent most of sunday trying to get update to work but could not figure out why it was loading my form in null.
